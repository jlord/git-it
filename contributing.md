### Git-it Challenge Completions

If you're working through the challenges in [Git-it](http://www.github.com/jlord/git-it-electron), you'll know most of this, but for the record: 

- Fork this repository.

- Create a branch named in this pattern: `add-<username>`, where username, not in brackets, is your GitHub username. 

- Create a file inside of `/contributors` named `add-<username>.txt`, where username, not in brackets, is your GitHub username. That file should just contain your username.
  
- Push your branch to your fork.

- Add @reporobot as a collaborator to your fork.

- Pull in changes that @reporobot will make to the file (he's gonna awesomize your username!)

- Submit a pull request to this repository against your `add-<username>` branch.
  
  
### Bug fixes to Patchwork Site

If you're contributing a patch to the Patchwork HTML page itself, make sure the branch name for the branch you create for your changes **does not** include your GitHub username. As a part of the Git-it workshop that uses this repository, users complete the challenge on pull requests with a branch that includes their username. In order to keep bug fixes separate from workshop completions -- don't use your username in your branch :)
