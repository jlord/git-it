# Git-it

![ss](https://raw2.github.com/jlord/git-it/master/git-it-ss.png)

A [workshopper](https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper) module for learning Git and GitHub - Social coding, y'all.

These modules run a little app in your terminal and users work their way through the challenges. See [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io) for more.

## Hello, future Forkers, Branchers and Pull Requesters!

This app runs in your Terminal (Mac) or Bash (Windows) and has challenges for learning Git and GitHub. It uses the _real_ terminal (so you'll be learning the awesome command line), it uses _real_ Git and GitHub which means when you finish all of the challenges you'll have _real_ repositories on your GitHub account and green squares on your [contribution chart](https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions).

See what topics are covered in Git-it on the [challenge table of contents](http://jlord.github.io/git-it) within the Git-it guide.

#### What you'll need to run Git-it:

_A few development essentials, all are free and/or free and open source._

- **Git**, this is your tracker of changes!
 - If you're on **Windows, download [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com)**, which includes Git, and use the **Git Shell** for your terminal.
 - If you're on a **Mac, download [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com)**, which includes Git, and select Preferences > Advanced > Install Command Line Tools.
- **Node.js**, this is what this app is written in so you'll need this to run it. It's an engine for running JavaScript on servers (your computer is a server!) and will live quietly in the background. You can **download Node [here](http://nodejs.org/download/)** (For most, you can just pick the **Windows `.msi`** or **Mac `.pkg`** option).
- **Text Editor**, if you don't have one already, you may want one for editing code*. A few options: [Atom](http://www.atom.io), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), [Textmate](http://macromates.com/download), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

_*There actually isn't "coding" required to complete Git-it so you're fine to use the default Notepad or TextEdit that comes with Mac/PC._

#### Install Git-it

Once you have the essentials above, install Git-it.

- Open up a terminal window and install Git-it globally on your computer (so that you can run it from anywhere). [NPM](http://www.npmjs.org) (**which is included when you download Node.js**) delivers Node.js modules (that's what this app is) to your computer from the command line, real easy like:

```bash
$ npm install -g git-it
```
- _If you run into trouble with this command it may be due to permissions on your computer, **try adding 'sudo'**:_ `sudo npm install -g git-it`
- Once it's done installing components, you can run it:

```bash
$ git-it
```
- This should load the menu. You're ready to go! Select the first challenge, hit enter and you're on your way!

#### How it Works

- Use the arrows ↑↓ to select the first challenge and press 'enter'.
- Open the guide, which is built into Git-it, with the instructions listed at the bottom of a challenge. _Preview a web hosted version of the guide [here](http://jlord.github.io/git-it)._

- Read the instructions in the guide and use your terminal to complete the tasks.
- When you're done with a challenge, type `git-it verify` in terminal.
- If the challenge components were not completed correctly, Git-it returns some text to help you know what went wrong.

**If you have any questions about something, just create a [new issue](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/issues/new) or visit the [troubleshooting doc](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOT.md).**

#### Tips For Getting Started

**Code snippets** often times look like `$ some code-stuff --here`. The dollar sign identifies the line as one a user would enter into the the command line, but you don't actually include it when you type it into terminal. In this case, you'd actually just type `some code-stuff --here`.

**Variables** are indicated by `<VARIABLENAME>` in code snippets. When you actually use the line of code, replace it, including the `<>`, with your variable. For instance to make a new folder in terminal the format is, `mkdir <FOLDERNAME>`, so if you wanted to make a folder named 'octocat', you'd type: `mkdir octocat`.

**Command line, terminal, bash** all basically mean the same thing: the MS-DOS, Doogie Howser looking screen full of words and numbers. It's awesomely powerful and allows you to control your computer with text commands.

You can do a lot of things from your terminal like delete, rename, copy or create files and folders; run scripts and send things back and forth between servers (like the ones storing things on GitHub.com) and your computer (also a server!).
