Hi, there! This is the repository for the original Git-it, the version that runs in your terminal. There is a new version, a desktop app, which lives at [jlord/git-it-electron](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron). **This one still works and you can use it if you want.** But I won't be actively maintaining it as I'll be focusing on the desktop version going forward.
