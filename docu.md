1. Install this workshop module globally `npm install -g git-it`
2. Create a folder to put your work in for this workshop.

 b. Pro-tip: Start learning the command line!
  - Open a Terminal (Mac) or Bash (Windows) window
  - Type `mkdir code` to make a directory (folder) for your code projects
  - Type `cd code` to navigate into that folder
  - Type `mkdir git-it` to create a folder for this workshop
  - Type `cd git-it` to navigate into that folder
3. From Terminal/Bash, run this module from inside the folder you created for it
 - `npm install` to install the modules it depends on
 - `git-it` to get started.

Awesome! Select the first challenge and be on your way!
