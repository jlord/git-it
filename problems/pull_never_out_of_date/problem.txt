  Keep your file up to date, pull in changes from collaborators.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  If you're working on something with someone you need to stay up
  to date with the latest version. So you'll want to {bold}pull{/bold} in any 
  changes that may have been made.
  
  {bold}{cyan}
  Pull in Changes{/bold}
  -----------------{/cyan}

  See if Reporobot has made any changes to your 'add-' branch by pulling
  in from the remote named 'origin' on GitHub:

  $ git pull <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME>

  If nothing's changed, it will tell you 'Already up-to-date'. 
  If there are changes, it will merge those changes into your local 
  version.
  
  Did Reporobot make changes? Git tells you where changes were made.
  You can open that file and see Reporobot's updates. Surprise, 
  Reporobot is an artist!
  
  When you've pulled, type `git-it verify`.
