  Git is {bold}open source software{/bold} (free for anyone to use) written
  by Linus Torvalds who also wrote the Linux operating system. 

  It is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in 
  programming as {bold}version control{/bold}.

  {cyan}To install Git{/cyan}

  - Visit {bold}http://git-scm.com/downloads{/bold} and download the version for 
  the operating system that you're using.
  - You can also download GitHub for Windows or Mac, which includes 
  Git and has an easier installation: {bold}mac.github.com{/bold}, 
  {bold}windows.github.com{/bold}
  - Follow the installation instructions (see notes below for more
  details).

  Git isn't like other programs on your computer. You'll likely not 
  see an icon on your desktop, but it will always be available to you
  and you'll be able to access it at anytime from you're 
  terminal (which you're in right now!) or Git desktop applications.
  
  Once it is installed, open terminal. You can verify that it's really
  there by typing:
  
  $ git -v 
  
  This will return the version of Git that you're running.
  
  Next, configure Git so it knows who to associate your changes to:
  
  Set your name:
  
  $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  
  Now set your email:

  $ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com

  When you're done type into terminal:

  $ git-it verify 

  PRO TIP: Dollar signs are often used in programming documentation
  to signify that the line is command line code. You don't actually 
  type it in, though, only type `git-it verify`.
  
  When you finish each challenge, type `git-it` to see the menu and
  go to the next challenge. Some of the challenges are longer than the
  screen, so don't forget to scroll up to where it begins after it 
  loads!
  
  Notes: For Windows users installing Git alone (and not the GitHub
  Desktop version), you'll want to select to run Git from the command
  prompt and the first option on the next window.
