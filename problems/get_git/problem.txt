  Git is {bold}open source software{/bold} (free for anyone to use) written
  by Linus Torvalds who also wrote the Linux operating system. 

  It is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in 
  programming as {bold}version control{/bold}.

  {cyan}To install Git{/cyan}

  - Visit {bold}http://git-scm.com/downloads{/bold} and download the version for 
  the operating system that you're using.
  - Follow the installation instructions.

  Git isn't like other programs on your computer. You'll likely not 
  see an icon on your desktop, but it will always be available to you
  and you'll be able to access it at anytime from you're 
  terminal (which you're in right now!) or Git desktop applications.

  When you're done type into terminal

  $ git-it verify 

  PRO TIP: Dollar signs are often used in programming documentation
  to signify that the line is command line code. You don't actually 
  type it in, though, only type `git-it veryify`.
